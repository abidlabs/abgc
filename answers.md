**1. B. 20 weeks**
In standard clinical and ABGC nomenclature, a fetal demise occurring at or after 20 weeks of gestation is classified as a stillbirth. Losses prior to 20 weeks are classified as spontaneous abortions or miscarriages.

**2. C. Prioritize the request for the pathology and cytogenetic reports from the 19-week loss...**
The history of a 19-week loss with specific malformations (fluid, short limbs) suggests a distinct genetic etiology (likely skeletal dysplasia) rather than sporadic aneuploidy. Obtaining these records is the most high-yield step to determine the specific recurrence risk for the current pregnancy.

**3. B. Offer CVS with a targeted gene panel for skeletal dysplasias, including *FGFR3* sequencing.**
The "cloverleaf skull" (Kleeblattschädel) and extreme limb shortening are classic features of Thanatophoric Dysplasia (caused by *FGFR3* mutations). While often de novo, confirming the diagnosis allows for targeted testing to rule out recurrence (due to germline mosaicism) given the current ultrasound findings.

**4. B. Maternal pre-gestational diabetes**
Caudal regression sequence (sacral agenesis) is a distinct congenital malformation strongly associated with poorly controlled maternal diabetes mellitus prior to conception. While not the most common anomaly in diabetic pregnancies (cardiac is), it is the most specific.

**5. B. The timing of exposure relative to the development of the neural crest-derived structures.**
Isotretinoin is a potent teratogen affecting neural crest migration; the risk is highest if exposure occurs during the critical window (roughly weeks 2–5 post-conception). Exposure outside this window significantly alters the risk calculation.

**6. C. Offer a chromosomal microarray to rule out 22q11.2 deletion...**
Retinoic Acid Embryopathy (thymic, cardiac, ear defects) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome share a significant phenotypic overlap (phenocopy). Because the patient has a family history of 22q11.2 deletion, it is critical to distinguish between the teratogenic effect and a heritable genetic condition.

**7. B. Encephalocele, multicystic dysplastic kidneys, and post-axial polydactyly.**
This is the classic clinical triad for Meckel-Gruber syndrome, a lethal ciliopathy. Identification of these features on ultrasound should prompt a differential including this recessive condition.

**8. B. Cri-du-chat syndrome (5p-)**
The "cat-like" high-pitched cry is pathognomonic for Cri-du-chat syndrome. Microcephaly and hypertelorism are also supportive clinical features of this chromosomal deletion.

**9. A. Karyotype, to identify a possible balanced translocation in a parent.**
The "Greek Warrior Helmet" profile is classic for Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (4p-), which is a large deletion often visible on a standard karyotype. A karyotype is essential to rule out a balanced translocation in one of the parents, which would significantly increase the recurrence risk.

**10. B. A "low fetal fraction" result on cell-free DNA screening at 11 weeks.**
Low fetal fraction is associated with an increased risk for Triploidy, Trisomy 18, and Trisomy 13, all of which are time-sensitive diagnoses. Triage protocols prioritize this because the window for diagnostic procedures (like CVS) or pregnancy management decisions is limited.

**11. B. Detailed ultrasound report and images of the fetal heart and profile.**
The "strawberry-shaped skull" and clenched hands are hallmark signs of Trisomy 18. A detailed ultrasound is needed to identify associated cardiac defects or other structural anomalies to strengthen the clinical suspicion before invasive testing.

**12. B. Prioritize Trisomy 18 as the likely etiology regardless of the medication.**
The "strawberry skull" is a highly specific marker for Trisomy 18 and is not typically associated with folic acid antagonist exposure (which causes neural tube defects). Therefore, the genetic etiology (aneuploidy) is more likely than the teratogenic one.

**13. B. Spina Bifida**
The neural tube closes bi-directionally; failure of the anterior neuropore to close results in anencephaly, while failure of the posterior neuropore results in spina bifida (myelomeningocele). This closure typically finishes by day 28 of development.

**14. B. Gross motor, fine motor, and language.**
Walking is a gross motor skill (expected ~12 months), pincer grasp is fine motor (expected ~9–10 months), and speaking words is language (expected ~12 months). The child is delayed in all three areas, suggesting global developmental delay.

**15. B. del(5p)**
This connects the developmental delay case to the clinical features of Cri-du-chat (5p-). The "cat-like cry" combined with global delays and microcephaly is the defining presentation of this deletion syndrome.

**16. B. Fabry disease**
Fabry disease (alpha-galactosidase A deficiency) is a lysosomal storage disorder treated with Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT). PKU is treated with diet, and while treatments exist for the others, ERT is the primary modality for Fabry.

**17. B. Echocardiogram to measure the aortic root diameter.**
Pregnancy places significant hemodynamic stress on the cardiovascular system. For women with Marfan syndrome, the risk of aortic dissection is high, especially if the aortic root is dilated (>4.0–4.5 cm), making this the critical safety assessment before conception.

**18. B. The mother should be screened for symptoms of FXPOI (Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency).**
Since the son has a full mutation, the mother is an obligate carrier (likely of a premutation). Female premutation carriers are at risk for FXPOI (early menopause) and FXTAS (ataxia), which should be discussed during counseling.

**19. C. Phenylketonuria (PKU)**
PKU is caused by an inability to metabolize phenylalanine; management requires a strict diet low in protein/phenylalanine to prevent neurotoxicity. Early initiation of this diet prevents severe intellectual disability.

**20. B. Cardiology referral for EKG to monitor for a prolonged QT interval.**
Rett syndrome (*MECP2*) is associated with autonomic dysfunction and a prolonged QT interval, which can lead to sudden cardiac death. Routine cardiac monitoring is a standard part of the management guidelines.

**21. B. Avoid fasting for more than 4 hours to prevent metabolic crisis and hypoglycemia.**
VLCADD is a fatty acid oxidation disorder, meaning the body cannot utilize fat for energy during fasting. The most critical immediate intervention is to prevent hypoglycemia by ensuring frequent feeding.

**22. C. An arrow pointing to the symbol of the affected individual.**
In pedigree nomenclature, the "Proband" (the individual through whom the family came to medical attention) is indicated by an arrow pointing to their symbol.

**23. B. 50%**
DMD is X-linked recessive. The woman is an obligate carrier (affected brother and uncle). She has a 50% chance of passing the X chromosome with the mutation to her son, who would then be affected.

**24. A. 1/3**
This is a Bayesian calculation. Prior risk is 1/2. The conditional probability of being a carrier *and* not showing symptoms is  (since penetrance at this age is 50%).

* Likelihood (Carrier & Asymptomatic) = 0.25.
* Likelihood (Non-Carrier) = 0.5.
* Posterior = .

**25. B. **
In the Hardy-Weinberg equation (),  is the homozygous dominant,  is the homozygous recessive (affected), and  represents the frequency of heterozygous carriers.

**26. C. 1/100 (assuming population carrier frequency of 1/25)**
If the population carrier frequency is 1/25 (standard for Caucasians):
Risk = Mother (1, carrier)  Father (1/25, population risk)  Child inheriting both (1/4) = 1/100.

**27. C. 1/6 (approximate)**
The woman's prior risk is 2/3 (unaffected sibling of affected person).

* Carrier path:  (10% false negative rate) = 0.067.
* Non-carrier path:  = 0.333.
* Posterior = .

**28. B. Residual Risk**
Residual risk is the calculated probability that an individual is a carrier despite a negative screening result. It is never zero because screening tests do not have 100% sensitivity.

**29. D. 1/6000**
The partner's prior risk is 1/300. With a 95% detection rate, his residual risk is approx . (Calculation: Risk  Prior  (1-Sensitivity)).

**30. B. Offer prenatal diagnosis via CVS or amniocentesis...**
Even with a negative screen, the partner's residual risk combined with the mother's carrier status often results in a fetal risk higher than the general population risk or the procedural risk of amniocentesis. Given the history of an affected child, definitive diagnostic testing should be offered.

**31. B. Pleiotropy**
Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. For example, a mutation in *FBN1* (Marfan) causes eye, heart, and skeletal issues.

**32. C. Anticipation due to triplet repeat expansion**
Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 is a trinucleotide repeat disorder that exhibits anticipation. The repeat size increases in successive generations (especially upon maternal transmission), leading to earlier onset and more severe symptoms (congenital myotonic dystrophy).

**33. B. Mitochondrial; nearly 100% for all children.**
Mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively from the mother. If a mother is homoplasmic for a mutation, she passes it to all her children; fathers do not pass mitochondria to offspring.

**34. B. MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification)**
MLPA is the standard method for detecting exon-level deletions and duplications (CNVs) within a specific gene, which are too small for karyotype but often missed by standard Sanger sequencing.

**35. B. Order RNA sequencing to look for splice-site variants...**
A significant portion of *NF1* pathogenic variants are deep intronic mutations that affect splicing. These are not covered by standard exon-based DNA panels, so RNA sequencing is the best next step to capture these transcript anomalies.

**36. B. The CMA is superior because it defines the exact genomic coordinates...**
A karyotype has a resolution of ~5–10 Mb and would likely miss a 2.5 Mb duplication. CMA (Chromosomal Microarray) provides the precise size and gene content, which helps differentiate between Williams (deletion) and the duplication syndrome phenotype.

**37. D. Benign**
If a variant is found at a high frequency in large population databases (like gnomAD) among healthy individuals, it is inconsistent with a pathogenic cause for a rare Mendelian disorder and is classified as Benign.

**38. B. No, testing unaffected relatives for a VUS is not clinically actionable...**
A Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) should not be used for predictive testing in unaffected family members because a positive result does not confirm high risk, and a negative result does not eliminate risk. Clinical management is based on family history, not the VUS.

**39. B. Contact the patient to update their risk assessment...**
Genetic counselors have a duty to re-contact patients when a reclassification impacts medical management. A change from VUS to Likely Pathogenic validates the diagnosis and necessitates cascade testing for family members.

**40. C. Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**
PPV is the proportion of positive test results that are true positives (i.e., the likelihood the patient actually has the disease given a positive result).

**41. B. The NPV will be high, but the PPV will likely be low...**
When the prevalence of a condition is very low, the number of false positives (even with good specificity) often outnumbers the true positives, resulting in a low PPV. This is a key concept in population screening.

**42. C. 31%**
.
.

**43. B. Somatic testing**
Somatic testing analyzes the DNA of the tumor cells to identify acquired mutations driving the cancer. This is distinct from germline testing, which looks for inherited mutations in every cell of the body.

**44. B. Predictive/Pre-symptomatic testing**
This testing is performed on an asymptomatic individual at risk for a specific genetic disorder to determine if they have inherited the mutation that will inevitably cause the disease later in life.

**45. B. A 50% VAF in a tumor sample is highly suggestive of a germline mutation...**
A Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) of ~50% in a tumor suggests that one of the two alleles in every cell carries the mutation, implying it might be germline (inherited). Confirmatory germline testing is required to prove this.

**46. B. Cultured skin fibroblasts**
White blood cells used in blood testing can yield inconclusive enzymatic results (especially after transfusions). Cultured skin fibroblasts provide a stable, distinct tissue source for measuring lysosomal enzyme activity.

**47. C. Skin biopsy for cultured fibroblasts**
Following an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, the patient's blood (WBCs) contains the donor's DNA. To test the patient's original germline genetics, a source free of hematopoietic cells, such as skin fibroblasts, is required.

**48. C. Perform sequencing on DNA extracted from a skin punch biopsy.**
Similar to the transplant scenario, CHIP is a somatic mutation restricted to blood cells. Testing DNA from skin fibroblasts (which are not derived from the hematopoietic lineage) will be negative if the mutation is CHIP, but positive if it is germline (Li-Fraumeni).

**49. C. PGT-SR (Structural Rearrangement)**
PGT-SR is the specific terminology for preimplantation testing designed to detect unbalanced chromosomal products resulting from a parent's balanced translocation or inversion.

**50. B. Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) for Microarray and Noonan syndrome panel.**
A significantly increased NT (>3.5mm) is associated with aneuploidy and RASopathies (Noonan syndrome). CVS allows for diagnostic testing (CMA + gene panel) in the first trimester, offering the earliest definitive answers.

**51. B. Confined Placental Mosaicism (CPM)**
CPM occurs when a chromosomal abnormality (like Monosomy X) is present in the placental cells (trophoblasts) but not in the fetus. Since cfDNA comes from the placenta, it tests positive, but the fetus is truly unaffected.

**52. B. Reflection/Echoing**
Reflection (or Rephrasing) involves repeating the client's words or the essence of their message. This validates the client's statement and encourages them to continue exploring that thought.

**53. B. Advanced empathy**
Advanced empathy involves the counselor identifying and articulating implied feelings or meanings that the client has not explicitly stated, helping the client gain deeper insight.

**54. B. Confrontation (or Engagement)**
In counseling, "confrontation" is a technique used to address a discrepancy or, in this case, silence/withdrawal. It is an invitation for the disengaged party to participate and validates their presence.

**55. B. Family Systems Theory**
This theory posits that individuals cannot be understood in isolation from one another; the family is an emotional unit, and a change in one member (diagnosis) affects the entire system's dynamic.

**56. D. Perceived self-efficacy (or Perceived Benefit)**
The sister feels that testing is useless because the outcome (getting cancer) is inevitable regardless of action. In the Health Belief Model, this represents a lack of Perceived Benefit or low Self-Efficacy (belief that one's action can influence the outcome).

**57. B. Recognize this as "Intellectualization"...**
Intellectualization is a defense mechanism where the patient focuses on facts and logic to avoid uncomfortable emotions. The counselor should validate the patient's knowledge (joining) before gently guiding them toward the emotional reality.

**58. B. Countertransference**
Countertransference is the counselor's emotional reaction to the client, often triggered by the counselor's own unresolved issues or personal history.

**59. C. Seek clinical supervision to explore these feelings...**
The ethical management of countertransference involves recognizing it and processing it in supervision to ensure it does not bias the counseling or harm the patient's autonomy.

**60. B. Projection; the counselor should correct the patient and state they have no opinion.**
The patient is projecting their own internal doubt or guilt onto the counselor ("You think I'm wrong"). The counselor must differentiate their own neutral stance from the patient's projected feelings.

**61. B. Medicare (CMS)**
Currently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) do not recognize genetic counselors as healthcare providers, meaning GCs cannot bill Medicare directly for their services.

**62. B. How the test results will directly alter the patient's clinical management...**
Insurance coverage hinges on "medical necessity." The LMN must clearly demonstrate that the test result will change the medical plan (e.g., surgery, surveillance, medication), not just satisfy curiosity.

**63. C. $500**
Since the patient has met $4,500 of a $5,000 out-of-pocket maximum, they are only responsible for the remaining $500. Once the OOP max is met, the insurance typically pays 100%.

**64. C. Health insurance eligibility and employment**
GINA protects individuals from discrimination in health insurance (eligibility and premiums) and employment based on their genetic information.

**65. A. Using the genetic test result to make a promotion or firing decision.**
GINA Title II strictly prohibits employers from using genetic information for hiring, firing, promotion, or other employment decisions.

**66. B. Obtain new informed consent from the participants or a waiver from the IRB.**
Using identifiable samples for research outside the scope of the original consent constitutes human subjects research. The researcher must either get new consent or an IRB waiver (if criteria are met).

**67. C. Non-maleficence**
Non-maleficence is the ethical obligation to "do no harm." It requires professionals to avoid actions that could cause physical or psychological harm or exploitation.

**68. B. Perform the session for the student while they observe...**
The supervisor must ensure the patient receives standard-of-care counseling (Beneficence/Justice) while managing the student's development. Taking over prevents harm to the patient while allowing for a post-session educational discussion.

**69. C. Disclose the relationship to the medical center's compliance office and recuse oneself...**
Transparency and recusal are the standard methods for managing Conflicts of Interest (COI). The counselor must not be involved in decisions that could benefit the company they serve on the board of.

**70. B. ClinicalTrials.gov**
This is the U.S. National Library of Medicine's database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world, the primary resource for finding trials.

**71. A. The patient's literacy level and current emotional readiness...**
Psychosocial assessment is critical. Referring a patient who is in denial or not emotionally ready to a group of symptomatic individuals can be harmful (maleficence).

**72. B. Provide printed materials during the session and coordinate a direct referral...**
To ensure Justice (equitable care) and Beneficence, the counselor must adapt to the patient's barriers (lack of internet) by providing accessible, tangible resources and facilitating care coordination.

**73. A. Age 10–12**
FAP involves the development of hundreds/thousands of polyps starting in puberty. Screening (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) typically begins at age 10–12 to manage the high risk of colorectal cancer.

**74. C. Alternating Breast MRI and Mammogram every 6 months**
High-risk breast surveillance for *BRCA1* carriers typically involves annual MRI (starting age 25) and annual mammogram (starting age 30), staggered every 6 months to ensure frequent imaging.

**75. B. Explore the patient's specific barriers and fears...**
Using a Motivational Interviewing approach, the counselor should validate the burden of the protocol ("screening fatigue") and work with the patient to find a path forward rather than dismissing their feelings or using fear tactics.

**76. B. Joubert syndrome**
The "molar tooth sign" is a specific malformation of the midbrain-hindbrain junction seen on MRI, characteristic of Joubert syndrome (a ciliopathy).

**77. D. Either A or B (JAG1 or NOTCH2)**
The features described (cholestasis, butterfly vertebrae, cardiac stenosis, facies) are classic for Alagille syndrome. While *JAG1* is the most common cause, *NOTCH2* mutations also cause this condition.

**78. B. Dynein arm defects in cilia; order ciliary biopsy or genetic panel...**
The triad of situs inversus, sinusitis, and bronchiectasis constitutes Kartagener syndrome (Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia). It is caused by defects in ciliary motility (dynein arms), leading to male infertility and respiratory issues.

**79. B. Founder effect**
The Founder Effect occurs when a new population is established by a small number of individuals, leading to reduced genetic variation and high frequencies of specific alleles (like Tay-Sachs in Ashkenazi Jews) due to the small starting gene pool.

**80. C. 1/25**
Using Hardy-Weinberg: Incidence () = 1/2500.  = . Carrier frequency () .

**81. B. Heterozygote advantage (balancing selection)**
This describes a situation where the heterozygote (carrier) has a higher fitness than either homozygote (affected or wild-type) in a specific environment (malaria presence), maintaining the deleterious allele in the population.

**82. B. Person-Centered (Rogerian) Model**
Developed by Carl Rogers, this model emphasizes the therapeutic relationship, relying on empathy, genuineness, and unconditional positive regard to facilitate the client's growth.

**83. B. Intellectualization**
The patient is using extensive research and organization (intellectual activity) to distance themselves from the anxiety and emotional weight of the diagnosis.

**84. B. Countertransference**
The counselor is projecting their own desire for parental care (from their own history) onto the child/family dynamic, interfering with their professional neutrality.

**85. C. Justice**
Justice is the ethical principle concerning fairness, equity, and the impartial distribution of benefits, risks, and resources (like healthcare access) among the population.

**86. C. Autonomy vs. Non-maleficence**
The conflict is between respecting the patient's right to control their own information (Autonomy) and the counselor's desire to prevent harm to at-risk relatives who could benefit from screening (Non-maleficence).

**87. B. Potential Conflict of Interest...**
Accepting "free" tests in exchange for volume creates a financial conflict where the clinic might order tests based on the deal rather than the patient's best interest. This violates the code of ethics regarding COI.

**88. A. Legius Syndrome; management is simpler...**
Legius syndrome (*SPRED1*) mimics the pigmentary features of NF1 (CALs, freckling) but does not cause neurofibromas or Lisch nodules. Distinguishing it prevents unnecessary, lifelong tumor surveillance.

**89. B. Pompe disease**
Pompe disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type II) is caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (*GAA*) deficiency. It causes cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness and is now on the RUSP for newborn screening.

**90. B. Folic Acid**
The "lemon sign" (inward scalloping of frontal bones) is a classic ultrasound marker for open spina bifida. Periconceptional folic acid supplementation is the most effective prevention for neural tube defects.

**91. B. ACGC (Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling)**
The ACGC accredits the master's degree training programs. The ABGC (American Board of Genetic Counseling) certifies the individual counselors (Board Exam).

**92. B. If the counselor holds a license to practice in the state where the patient is located.**
Telemedicine regulations generally require the provider to be licensed in the state where the *patient* is physically located at the time of the service.

**93. B. Whether the data is de-identified...**
Under the Common Rule, if data is fully de-identified and the researcher cannot readily ascertain the identity of the subjects, the project may not meet the definition of "Human Subjects Research" or may be exempt from full review.
